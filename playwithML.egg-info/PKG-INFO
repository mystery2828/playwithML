        ## Overview
        * This is a intuitive way of implementing Machine Learning models without writing even a single line of code.
        * This is a supervised Machine Learning based Project in which you can Upload a Dataset of your choice,
        * View the Charts and Bar graphs related to the Dataset,
        * Select the type of model (Classification or Regression),
        * Select which model to train on,
        * Click on the TRAIN button,
        * Finally get the Scores, Code and Report for your Model :)
        
        ## Installation
        The Code is written in Python 3.7. If you don't have Python installed you can find
        it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
        If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package,
        ensuring you have the latest version of pip. 
        To install the required packages and libraries, run this command in the project 
        directory:
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/mystery2828/playwithML.git
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
